## Project 3 Proposal

My design for project 3 is to try and classify whether someone is active enough to qualify for health insurance discounts based on accelerometer data.

My data for the project is 30 people between the ages of 19-48 who have recorded and labeled accelerometer data. The goal is to classify which type of activity they're doing including Walking, Sitting, etc. The data contains ~10k rows and 563 features. The data is labeled with 6 activities that each person is performing at different times. They are: standing, walking, sitting, laying, walking downstairs, walking upstairs. Each subject has about 300-400 entries we can try and classify.  

The first goal will be to predict their activity after training a model. Then, if there's time, I will attempt to say how much each exercise should be worth given the age range and costs of associated health care plans.
